# Deep Learning Live Feed Object Detection

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically detect and track objects in real-time video feeds. The images used for training are annotated in yolov3 format with labelimg. DarkNet is used to train the model on GPU's and the output is collected to perform an analysis on the loss function. The OpenCV library is used to capture live stream video. Each frame is captured, processed with the model, integrated with an object detection bounding box, and displayed to the end user in real-time. 

 The CNN splits the input image into a grid of NÃ—N cells. The center of the defined bouding box(i.e. ground truth) is identified as one of the cells, then that cell becomes responsible for detecting that object
 
* Coordinates of B bounding boxes - the CNN predicts 4 coordinates for each bounding box (tx,ty,tw,th). Where x and y are set to be offset of a cell location.
* Objectness score - the probability that the cell contains an object. The objectness score is passed through a sigmoid function to be treated as a probability with a value range between 0 and 1. 
* Class prediction - if the bounding box contains an object, the network predicts the probability of K number of classes. Where K is the total number of classes in your problem.

A graphical representation of the workflow follows:

Notice that the prediction feature map has three boxes. The CNN has 9 anchors to allow for prediction at 3 different scales per cell. The detection layer makes detection at feature maps of three different sizes, having strides 32, 16, and 8 respectively. This results in the prediction of 3 bounding boxes for each cell. The bounding box responsible for detecting the dog will be the one whose anchor has the highest intersection over union with the ground truth box.

**Follow [this guide](#getting-started) and you will be able to create your own live stream object detection:**

## Getting Started

These instructions will allow you to run your own live-stream object detection.

You can chose to [use the pre-trained model](#option-1-use-the-pre-trained-model)
or you can [train your own model](#option-2-train-a-custom-model)

### Prerequisites

* python3
* opencv-python
* matplotlib
* labelimg
* google_images_search
* sips

### Clone Repository

This codebase was developed and tested in PyCharm.

1. Donwload the [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)

2. Clone this repository into the PyCharm IDE.
    ```
    https://github.com/nashebismaily/deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection.git
    ```
3. Configure your project interpreter as follows:

    ![interpreter](resources/icons/interpreter.png)

### Download Base Weights Files

[Base Weights File](https://srv-file14.gofile.io/download/KySboR/darknet53.conv.74)

Place darknet53.conv.74 into this folder:

```
deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/weights
```

### Option 1: Use the Pre-Trained Model

Download my pre-trained model:

[Pre-Trained ML Model](https://srv-file6.gofile.io/download/Bfj367/yolov3.weights)

Place yolov3.weights into this folder:

```
deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/weights
```

### Option 2: Train a Custom Model

1. Add your google api keys, update your image search, and download images:

    ```
    [image_download]
    search_string=car,truck,buss,motercycle,bicycle,dog,cat,fire hydrant,stop sign
    base_download_dir=/Downloads
    google_api_key=
    google_project_cx=
    
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/images/DownloadImages.py
    ```
    
    **Note:** If you don't have google api keys and want a quick workaround, use this [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/download-all-images/ifipmflagepipjokmbdecpmjbibjnakm?hl=en)

2. Pre-process images through resizing
    ```
    sips -Z 1024 *.jpg 

    sips  : the command and -Z keeps the image's aspect ratio
    1024  : the maximum width and height
    *.jpg : converts every image ending in .jpg
    ```

3. Use labelImg to annotate each image, ensure YOLO is set as the output type

    ```
    labelImg
    ```

    ![labelImg](resources/icons/labelImg.png)

4. Update the objects.names file to contain a list of objects that have been labeled

    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/config/objects.names 
    ```

5. Split the data into test and training sets. 
    
    * train.txt will contains absolute path to images for training
    * test.txt will contains absolute path to images for testing
    * label files need to be in the same directory as images
     
    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/config/test.txt
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/config/train.txt
    
    /root/photos/image1.jpg
    /root/photos/image2.jpg
    /root/photos/image3.jpg
    ...
    ```

6. Download and install darknet to help model training

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet
    cd darknet
    make
    ```

7.  Configure darknet based directory

    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/config/darknet.cfg
    
    [darknet]
    darknet_base_dir=/root/darknet
    
    ```
8. Fine tune the model detection algorithm

    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/config/yolov3.cfg
    
    Set 'batch' to 16
    Set 'subdivisions' to 4
    Set 'classes' to the number of objects to detect
    Set 'filters' to (classes + 5)* 3
    Set 'max_batches' to the number of classes * 2000 
    Set 'steps' to 80% and 90% of max_batches.
    ```

9. Train the Model

    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/src/main/model/TrainModel.py
    ```
    
10. View the training output here:

    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/logs
    ```

11. Once training is complete, observe the loss graph found here:

    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/graphs
    ```

    ![darknetlossgraph](resources/icons/darknetlossgraph.png)

12. Select the appropriate weight that correlates to the elbow in the loss graph and move that here:

    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/weights/yolov3.weights
    ```

    
### Detect Objects in Static Images

1. Add the path for the source and destination images into the config under the image section

    ```
    deep-learning-liveconf-feed-object-detection/config/detection.cfg

    input_image=/root/photos/input_photo.jpg
    output_image=/root/photos/output_photo.jpg
    ```

    ```
    deep-learning-liveconf-feed-object-detection/src/main/detection/DetectImage.py
    ```

### Detect Objects in Video

1. Add the path for the source and destination videos into the config under the video section.

   **Note:** The output video needs to be in .avi format
   
    ```
    deep-learning-liveconf-feed-object-detection/config/detection.cfg

    input_video=/root/videos/input_video.mov
    output_video=/root/videos/output_video.avi

    [0]
    ```

2. Update detection.cfg with your selected device id

    ```
    deep-learning-liveconf-feed-object-detection/config/detection.cfg

    device_id=0
    ```

3. Run the live-stream  object detection

    ```
    deep-learning-liveconf-feed-object-detection/src/main/detection/DetectCamera.py
    ```

## Optional: Fine Tune Bounding Box

The Bounding Box in each frame can be fine tuned by updating the following properties:

```
deep-learning-liveconf-feed-object-detection/config/boundingbox.cfg

[blob]
output_width:   spatial width for output image
output_length:  spatial length for output image
mean:	        scalar with mean values which are subtracted from channels. 
                values are intended to be in (mean-R, mean-G, mean-B) order if image has BGR ordering and swapRB is true
scalefactor:    multiplier for image values
swapRB:	        flag which indicates that swap first and last channels in 3-channel image is necessary
crop:	        flag which indicates whether image will be cropped after resize or not
confidence:     requried confidence for succesfully detecting an image
threshold:      threshold used in non maximum suppression

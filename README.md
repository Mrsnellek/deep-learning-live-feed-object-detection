# Deep Learning Live Feed Object Detection

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically detect and track objects in real-time video feeds. The images used for training are annotated in yolov3 format with labelimg. DarkNet is used to train the model on GPU's and the output is collected to perform an analysis on the loss function. The OpenCV library is used to capture live stream video. Each frame is captured, processed with the model, integrated with an object detection bounding box, and displayed to the end user in real-time. 

 The CNN splits the input image into a grid of NÃ—N cells. The center of the defined bouding box(i.e. ground truth) is identified as one of the cells, then that cell becomes responsible for detecting that object
 
* Coordinates of B bounding boxes - the CNN predicts 4 coordinates for each bounding box (tx,ty,tw,th). Where x and y are set to be offset of a cell location.
* Objectness score - the probability that the cell contains an object. The objectness score is passed through a sigmoid function to be treated as a probability with a value range between 0 and 1. 
* Class prediction - if the bounding box contains an object, the network predicts the probability of K number of classes. Where K is the total number of classes in your problem.

**Follow [this guide](#getting-started) and you will be able to create your own live stream object detection:**

**DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS**

## Getting Started

These instructions will allow you to run your own live-stream object detection.

You can chose to [use the pre-trained model](#option-1-use-the-pre-trained-model)
or you can [train your own model](#option-2-train-a-custom-model)

### Prerequisites

* python3
* opencv-python
* matplotlib
* labelimg
* imutils
* google_images_search
* sips

### Clone Repository

This codebase has been tested on RHEL7 and MacOS-PyCharm

1. Clone this repository
    ```
    https://github.com/nashebismaily/deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection.git
    ```
2. Install packages
    ```
    pip3 install opencv-python
    pip3 install matplotlib
    pip3 install labelimg
    pip3 install imutils
    pip3 install google_images_search
    pip3 install sips
    ```
3. OPTIONAL: Donwload the [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)

4. OPTIONAL: Configure your project interpreter as follows:

    ![interpreter](resources/icons/interpreter.png)

### Download Base Weights Files

[Base Weights File](https://srv-file14.gofile.io/download/KySboR/darknet53.conv.74)

Place darknet53.conv.74 into this folder:

```
deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/weights
```

### Option 1: Use the Pre-Trained Model

Download my pre-trained model:

[Pre-Trained ML Model](https://srv-file6.gofile.io/download/Bfj367/yolov3.weights)

Place yolov3.weights into this folder:

```
deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/weights
```

### Option 2: Train a Custom Model

1. Add your google api keys, update your image search, and download images:

    ```
    [image_download]
    search_string=car,truck,buss,motercycle,bicycle,dog,cat,fire hydrant,stop sign
    base_download_dir=/Downloads
    google_api_key=
    google_project_cx=
    
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/images/DownloadImages.py
    ```
    
    **Note:** If you don't have google api keys and want a quick workaround, use this [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/download-all-images/ifipmflagepipjokmbdecpmjbibjnakm?hl=en)

2. Pre-process images through resizing
    ```
    sips -Z 1024 *.jpg 

    sips  : the command and -Z keeps the image's aspect ratio
    1024  : the maximum width and height
    *.jpg : converts every image ending in .jpg
    ```

3. Use labelImg to annotate each image, ensure YOLO is set as the output type

    ```
    labelImg
    ```

    ![labelImg](resources/icons/labelImg.png)

4. Update the objects.names file to contain a list of objects that have been labeled

    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/yolov/objects.names 
    ```

5. Split the data into test and training sets. 
    
    * train.txt will contains absolute path to images for training
    * test.txt will contains absolute path to images for testing
    * label files need to be in the same directory as images
     
    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/weights/train.txt
    
    /root/photos/image1.jpg
    /root/photos/image2.jpg
    /root/photos/image3.jpg
    ...
    
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/weights/test.txt

    /root/photos/image4.jpg
    /root/photos/image5.jpg
    /root/photos/image6.jpg  
    ...
    ```

6. Download and install darknet to help model training

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet
    cd darknet
    make
    ```

7.  Configure darknet based directory

    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/detection/config/detection.cfg
    
    [darknet]
    darknet_base_dir=/root/darknet
    
    ```
8. Fine tune the model detection algorithm

    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/detection/detect_image.py
    
    Set 'batch' to 16
    Set 'subdivisions' to 4
    Set 'classes' to the number of objects to detect
    Set 'filters' to (classes + 5)* 3
    Set 'max_batches' to the number of classes * 2000 
    Set 'steps' to 80% and 90% of max_batches.
    ```

9. Train the Model

    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/train_model.py
    ```
    
10. View the training output here:

    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/logs
    ```

11. Once training is complete, observe the loss graph found here:

    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/graphs
    ```

    ![darknetlossgraph](resources/icons/darknetlossgraph.png)

12. Select the appropriate weight that correlates to the elbow in the loss graph and move that here:

    ```
    deep-learning-live-feed-object-detection/model/weights/yolov3.weights
    ```
